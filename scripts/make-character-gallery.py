"""Build the Character gallery page from characters/.

    python3 scripts/make-character-gallery.py --out _site
    python3 scripts/make-character-gallery.py --self-check

Reads every Character Manifest, copies the frames the manifests name into
`<out>/characters/`, and writes `<out>/characters.html` — the page shell in
docs/design/characters.html with its data block substituted. A Generated page
under ADR-0011: the manifests are the source of the frame count, fps, loop,
render_mode, scale, weight, variant rings and attribution the page shows, so a
page that disagrees with a package cannot be deployed.

Pure standard library. tomllib reads the manifests and the frames are copied
byte for byte, so nothing here needs Pillow or a TOML dependency installed.

This script decides what gets published. .github/workflows/pages.yml names
files one by one for the hand-written pages, and that reviewed list is the
security model; it cannot name a few hundred PNGs. So the workflow names this
generator instead, and the guarantee moves here: only the files a manifest
names as frames are copied, only if they are PNGs inside their own package,
and the workflow re-checks every extension in _site afterwards.

Malformed input fails the build rather than reaching the page. A required
Animation a manifest simply does not declare is different: that is a fact
about the package the gallery exists to show, so it renders as a missing tile.
The loader already refuses to install such a package (crates/core/src/
character.rs), so nothing here is the only thing standing between it and a
user.
