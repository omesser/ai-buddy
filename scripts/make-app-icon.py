"""Cut the product logo to the macOS app icon grid.

The logo art is a full-bleed square, and nothing downstream rounds it: Tauri
hands the app icon to `NSApp.setApplicationIconImage` on a dev run and packs it
into the bundle for a built one, and neither path applies a mask. Shipped raw,
the Dock draws a hard-edged square that overhangs every neighbouring icon by
the margin they all leave. So the shape is baked in here — Apple's grid, an 824
body on a 1024 canvas, corners on a continuous-curvature squircle.

An authoring tool rather than a build step, so — like import-pet.py and unlike
the make-*-characters scripts — it is allowed to need Pillow.

    python3 scripts/make-app-icon.py

It rewrites branding/logo-art/app-icon-1024.png, src-tauri/icons/icon.png and
src-tauri/icons/icon.ico from branding/logo-art/logo-512.png, and redraws
branding/app-icon-preview.png so the artifact a reviewer looks at is never a
version behind the icon. The tray mark is a different shape for a different
surface and is never touched.
