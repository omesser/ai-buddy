# Scenario: launcher-dies-at-startup (macOS)
# On screen: launches Fidget as BMO with a fixture Harness whose first launch
#   aborts before initialize. The menu bar icon's menu opens and its Chat… row
#   is pressed, so Chat opens and takes focus. Chat is resized to 420 and 320
#   points, then Codex is pressed. Three screenshots. Fidget quits at the end.
# Input: one real click on the menu bar icon; AXPress on Chat… and Codex, a
#   click only if one refuses it (three at most); AX resizes; no keys.
# Duration: about 30 s, 2 min at most.
# Grants: Screen Recording and Accessibility for the terminal that runs it.
# Asserts: what only a live run can: the tray's Chat… row opens the Harness
#   error landing; at 420 and 320 its Error output and Command boxes end inside
#   the window and Error output starts above the composer; Codex, a re-pick
#   under FIDGET_HARNESS, launches the Harness again at once. Copy, labels and
#   capture are chat-landing-format.test.js's and the Rust tests'.
#
# Usage: launcher-dies-at-startup.sh --go <fidget binary> <fidget test binary>
# Without --go it prints this header, which is the takeover prompt, and exits 2.
