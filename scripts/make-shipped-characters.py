"""Draw Nim, the script-drawn shipped Character.

Nim is modern pixel art — a shaded ramp lit from the upper left, a translucent
contact shadow, and enough in-between frames that the motion reads as smooth
rather than stepped. BMO is not drawn here: its frames are static art cut from
a game sprite sheet and quantised to a fixed palette (see
characters/bmo/character.manifest), so the two shipped Characters still prove
the format against real variance — one generated, one drawn by hand elsewhere.

Pure standard library, as `make-blip-character.py` is and for the same
reason: a build step that needs Pillow installed is a build step that stops
working. The PNG writer is copied from there rather than shared, because a
third file to import would cost more than the twelve lines it saves.

    python3 scripts/make-shipped-characters.py

It rewrites characters/nim/frames/ in place. The manifests, the Personality
Prompts, and all of characters/bmo/ are written by hand and never touched.
