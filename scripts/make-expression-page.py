"""Build the overlay-expression page from src/bubble.js, src/main.css and
characters/buddy-bot/.

    python3 scripts/make-expression-page.py --out _site
    python3 scripts/make-expression-page.py --self-check

A Generated page under ADR-0011: the published HTML must load the overlay's
bubble module and the bubble rules sliced from main.css, so a reading-time
formula restated on the page cannot deploy. Malformed or missing bubble.js
fails the build the way a bad Character Manifest fails the gallery.

The sprite under the bubble is a shipped Character, not a coloured div, so
its Animations are the third input: which frames Buddy Bot's `idle` and
`talk` strips hold and at what fps is read from its own manifest here, and
the frames are copied beside the page. The committed shell carries the same
block naming the packages where that file can see them, two directories up,
and `require_current_sprite` fails the build when the two disagree — which is
the only way a hand-edited shell could start naming art it does not have.

That path is checkable, not runnable: bubble.css exists nowhere but here, so
the page is judged from `--out`, never from `docs/design/`.

Pure standard library. The CSS slice is text, not a parser, so it cannot
quietly pick up the overlay's transparent fullscreen rules sitting above
`.bubble`. Overlay `@import`s are inlined into that slice: the published
page is one file, and leaving `var(--shared-*)` unset would paint a
transparent hole.
